# Combines the memory of multiple GPUs into a partitioned global address space 
that’s accessed through NVSHMEM APIs.
# Includes a low-overhead, in-kernel communication API for use by GPU threads.
# Includes stream-based and CPU-initiated communication APIs.  
# Supports peer-to-peer communication using NVIDIA NVLink and PCI Express and for 
GPU clusters using NVIDIA Mellanox® InfiniBand. 
# Supports x86 and POWER9 processors.  
# Is interoperable with MPI and other OpenSHMEM implementations.
